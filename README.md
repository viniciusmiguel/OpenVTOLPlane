# OpenVTOLPlane

This is a very initial concept for a VTOL electric plane.

The first stage is conceptualize the fuselage an VTOR airplane to carry a payload of 120kg (One person).

The second stage is determine the total craft weigth using composites as carbon fiber, aramid and fiberglass.

The third stage is design the electrical motors with the power required and redundancy of motors to ensure safety, including in this process the battery packs weight to project.

After this stage we are ready to build an initial 1/10 scale model using common RC eletronics to validade the mechanical design and improve aerodynamics. 

The next stage is design the electronics that is composed of substages:
	- Design the linear actuator controllers.
	- Design the High Power Inverters
	- Design the kinematic controler with redundancy 
	- Design the auto pilot with redundancy  
	- Design the user interface ( cockpit )
	- Design the Power management unit.
	- Design the battery charger unit.

Last stage is the final prototype in 1/1 scale.
